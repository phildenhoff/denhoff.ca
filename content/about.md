# skills

As a UX designer, I create prototypes, workshop wireframes, user test, gain
feedback from stakeholders, and try to build the best experience I can. Most of
my work is done as a UX-team-of-one, but I always enjoy working with folks who
see things a little different than I do; that challenges our beliefs and builds
a better product!

I'm skilled in wireframing, prototyping, Adobe XD, and Adobe Illustrator. I
also have a solid grasp of programming topics and can work one-on-one with
developers to make our UX the best.


Like I said, I try to be a jack-of-all trades. So, I've also got experience with
the following technologies:

- Python, Go, Groovy, Javascript
- Vue.js
- Flask and Node.js
- AWS and GCP
- Chef.io
- Administration of Azure DevOps (previously VSTS), GoCD, Nexus, and Gitlab 
 
Now that I think about if, I have experience with about two of most things. I
tend to try something and then test out its alternatives to see how
they compare...

# employment history
<span class='employer'>Codan Radio Communications | UX Designer & DevOps Engineer</span>

_April 2018 - ongoing_

As UX Designer, I am responsible for redesigning Cascade's software interface.
I keep in touch with a number of stakeholders (product owner, software team,
marketing) to make sure all current requirements are satisfied, future
requirements are satisfiable, that the software is easy to write and maintain,
and that Cascade follows our existing brand guidelines. All while keeping the
experience for the people using our product enjoyable.

In my role as DevOps Engineer, I was also responsible for assisting and
de-risking a migration from GoCD, Nexus, and GitLab to Azure DevOps (previously
VSTS). I also worked to keep the four-man team's sprint in focus in my role as
scrum master. As a team, we built and maintained build agents using Chef.io,
migrated projects from Mercurial and hap-hazard builds to automated builds from
Git repositories, and began documenting an automated test framework for our
all teams in our division.
