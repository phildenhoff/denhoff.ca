Hi! I'm Phil

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada.

Currently, (as of the date above) I'm working at a radio repeater manufacturer here called [Codan Radio Communications](https://www.codanradio.com), writing scripts and helping manage an on-premise build system and artifact repository.

I like [building things](https://github.com/phildenhoff) and [watching movies](https://letterboxd.com/OverHonour/films). If you're interested in working with me, [send me an email](mailto:phildenhoff@gmail.com)! I love to hear about new projects, although I can't guarantee I'll be able to work on it.
