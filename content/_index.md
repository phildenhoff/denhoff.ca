I’m a third-year computer science student @ UVic. 

Mostly, I work with 
<mark class="highlight--yellow">Javascript</mark>
 and 
 <mark class="highlight--blue">Python</mark>
, but I very much like user interface design.

Right now, I’m creating radios at Codan Radio Communications in Victoria, BC.

In my spare time, I also sometimes build apps under 
<span style="white-space:nowrap">the branding of <img class="inline-image" src="/img/baseflow-logo@2x.png" alt="Baseflow"></span>

If you’ve got something you think I’d be interested in,  don’t hesistate to reach out:
