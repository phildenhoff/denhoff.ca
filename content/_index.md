</span>

Hi! I’m Phil, a UX/UI Designer and a computer science student @ [UVic](https://uvic.ca). 

Most of my side projects are in 
<mark class="highlight--yellow">[Javascript](/projects/#start-page)</mark>
and 
<mark class="highlight--blue">[Python](/projects/#hirethissnake)</mark>, but I'm expanding into experience design.

Right now, I’m designing the Cascade interface at [Codan Radio Communications](https://www.codanradio.com) in Victoria,
BC.

In my spare time, I also sometimes build apps under 
<span style="white-space:nowrap">the branding of [<img class="inline-image" src="/img/baseflow-logo@2x.png" alt="Baseflow">](https://baseflow.ca)</span>

Check out my [projects](/projects)!

If you’ve got something you think I’d be interested in,  don’t hesitate to reach out:
