I’m a third-year computer science student @ [UVic](https://uvic.ca). 

Mostly, I work with 
<mark class="highlight--yellow">[Javascript](/projects/#start-page)</mark>
and 
<mark class="highlight--blue">[Python](/projects/#hirethissnake)</mark>, but I very much like user interface design.

Right now, I’m creating radios at [Codan Radio Communications](https://www.codanradio.com) in Victoria, BC.

In my spare time, I also sometimes build apps under 
<span style="white-space:nowrap">the branding of [<img class="inline-image" src="/img/baseflow-logo@2x.png" alt="Baseflow">](https://baseflow.ca)</span>
