Hi! I’m Phil. I help people spend less time struggling with technology and
spend more time focused on what is important to them.

I've written a number of hobby side projects, mostly in
<mark class="highlight--yellow">[Javascript](/projects/#start-page)</mark>
and
<mark class="highlight--blue">[Python](/projects/#hirethissnake)</mark>, but
I've also worked with Rust, Nim, Scala, and Adobe XD.

For more about what I've done, check out my [projects](/projects)!

If you’ve got something you think I’d be interested in, don’t hesitate to email:
