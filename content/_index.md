![Photo of me. Hi!](./img/phildenhoff-headshot.jpg "That's me!")
</span>

Hi! I’m Phil. I think we could all spend a little less time on our phones and
a little more time with the people around us. Oh, also I'm a computer science student
at [UVic](https://www.uvic.ca/) and I work as a software developer/junior DevOps engineer/interface designer. Jack of all trades, master of none.

I've written a number of hobby side projects, mostly in 
<mark class="highlight--yellow">[Javascript](/projects/#start-page)</mark>
and 
<mark class="highlight--blue">[Python](/projects/#hirethissnake)</mark>, but
I've also worked with Rust, Nim, Scala, and Adobe XD.

For more about what I've done, check out my [projects](/projects)!

If you’ve got something you think I’d be interested in, don’t hesitate to email:
