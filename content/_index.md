Hi, I'm Phil, a fullstack software developer at [GoFetch](https://gofetch.ca).
We're helping pets live longer, healthier lives by increasing the amount of preventative care they receive.
And [we're hiring](mailto:phil@gofetch.ca?subject=I'm%20looking%20to%20help%20pets%20live%20healthier%20lives)!

In working across the stack, I tend to focus on improving build infrastructure, updating tooling, refactoring out technical debt, and planning new features.

While at work we tend to use [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), I've worked on a number of projects in other languages — including Python, Nim, and Scala.

For more about what I've done, check out my [projects](/projects)!

If you’ve got something you think I’d be interested in, don’t hesitate to email:
