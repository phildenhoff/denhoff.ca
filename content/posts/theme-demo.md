## Style Demo

I've just getting started with Hugo. Hugo's a "static site engine written in Go".
 Effectively, I write markdown, and it makes me a nice fancy website, with the
styling baked in from a theme.

It's super handy.

I'm hoping to write some articles in the future about things I learn / projects 
I build or work on, but when does anything ever go to plan ðŸ™ƒ
