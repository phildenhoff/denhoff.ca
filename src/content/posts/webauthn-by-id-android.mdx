title: Android won't get passkeys from other devices... unless you tell it what to get

I've been playing around with WebAuthn recently, building an app that uses it as the primary login method.
Building out the backend has been interesting — I'm constantly learning new stuff — but the frontend has been exhausting.

Here's one example. I'll try to keep it short.

In our flow, we want users to sign in by their username & passkey in one step.
Those passkeys might be stored in the platform authenticator or in a remote authenticator: think Android/iOS vs. iCloud/1Password/Bitwarden/another phone.

On Android, if you make a `navigator.credentials.get` call _without_ providing a list of allowed credentials in the `allowCredentials` option, we will **only get back the platform credentials**.
If no platform credentials have been set up for the relaying party's id (`rpId`), the user will be told they have none, and given no other info or options.
Android won't ask the user if they'd like to use a remote authenticator, like their hardware token or a different phone.

```typescript
// Android users will not be able to use a remote authenticator for this credential request
await navigator.credentials.get({publicKey: {
	challenge: ArrayBuffer,
    timeout: SIXTY_SECONDS,
    rpId: window.location.hostname,
    allowCredentials: [],
    userVerification: preferred
}});
```

However, if we _do_ provide a list of allowed credentials, Android will prompt only for **USB, Bluetooth or NFC devices** — I guess it doesn't support scanning QR codes from other phones, or password managers? 

``` ts
// Android users can use their BT, NFC, or USB authenticators for this.
// But not other phones.
await navigator.credentials.get({publicKey: {
	challenge: ArrayBuffer,
    timeout: SIXTY_SECONDS,
    rpId: window.location.hostname,
    allowCredentials: [{
      id: RemotelyStoredCredentialId,
      type: "public-key",
      transports: []
    }],
    userVerification: preferred
}});
```

On iOS, either call works — with or without the list of allowed credentials.
The first will look for valid credentials for the `rpId`, suggest them, **and provide an alternative option to use a remote authenticator**.
The second call, with the list of allowed credentials, will filter out anything local not in that list and, finding that there are no local credentials, suggest using a remote authenticator.

Why is Android like this? I don't know.
