Phil is a fullstack software developer interested in improving developer and user experience alike.

# experience

As a software developer, I tend to play a supporting role in writing library functions, doing refactors, creating reusable components, and designing feature architectures. I work with my team to create software that is maintainable, understandable, and feature-complete, while balancing our time-to-market. Software has no value until it's in our users hands.

I'm generally tool-agnostic. I don't particularly care what tool we use — Javascript or Rust, Netlify or virtual machines deployed on-prem — so long as the tool satisfies the job.

## Languages

- Javascript / Typescript
- Elixir
- Python
- Scala (Java)

## PaaS / IaaS

- Heroku
- Amazon Web Services
- Google Cloud Platform
- Administration of an Azure DevOps (previously VSTS) organization of ~20 users, including build pipelines, code repositories, artifacts, and project management

## Tools & utilities

- Doppler.io for secrets management of multiple projects across multiple environments
- Netlify and Render.com for continous deployments
- Chef.io & Ansible for managing reproducible builds
