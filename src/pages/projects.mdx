# ü™µ‚òÅÔ∏è logseq-raindrop

In 2022, I created [logseq-raindrop](https://github.com/phildenhoff/logseq-raindrop),
a plugin for the [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) note-taking app that syncs your
[Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io/) bookmarks and annotations into your Logseq
graph.

    alt="A screenshot of Logseq with the logseq-raindrop plugin window open. A Raindrop, with its highlights, has been imported into Logseq as a new page."
    style="aspect-ratio: 1.501;"
  />
  <figcaption>
    logseq-raindrop provides a window for importing Raindrop bookmarks and their
    annotations into Logseq one-at-a-time.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

logseq-raindrop is written in TypeScript.
Plugins run as iframes within the Logseq app, so the UI is built using Svelte.

In 2023, I began an overhaul of how the plugin works. First, by abstracting the
Logseq API behind a _fa√ßade_ (which allowed me to write a mock Logseq client for
testing), and then by adding new functionality to support syncing all bookmarks
to a single page.
This is similar to how Omnivore's Logseq plugin works, and was heavily requested
by users.

I continue to chip away at logseq-raindrop, and I'm excited to see where it
goes.
I have a sense that what I've been building is much more than one plugin; I've
started to think of it as a library for building connections between
read-it-later apps and note-taking tools.
Why have one plugin for Raindrop.io and one for Pocket, when you could have one
plugin that supports both?
Or even just support a generic API for syncing bookmarks and annotations?

Of course, I best be careful ‚Äî talk like this is dangerously close to Readwise's
product.

# üåä bsflw/harbour

I created [harbour](https://github.com/bsflw/harbour) to act as a proxy so that
Git can use Keybase to sign git commits, instead of using GnuPG2.

It's written in Go, and is mostly a straightforward proxy ‚Äî Git calls harbour,
Harbour talks to Keybase, translates back to something Git will accept.
Getting Git to accept the responses was the most difficult part, as I generally
had to reverse engineer the "accepted values" for different requests.

Not long after I started working on the project, Keybase was acquired by Zoom.
I have no interest in trusting my secrets to a company that has proven to
have a poor track record with security, so I stopped using Keybase and archived
the project.

However, I'm glad I had the chance to work with Git's internals. It was a fun
challenge to translate the responses from Keybase into something Git would
accept. This project, in part, was what led me to explore some other version
control projects, including [Gitless](https://gitless.com/) and
[jj](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj).

# üîó shorturl & domainator-nim

Inspired by an article I read about the Nim programming language, I decided to
rewrite my existing Python project
[domainator](https://github.com/phildenhoff/domainator) in
Nim as [domainator-nim](https://github.com/phildenhoff/domainator-nim).

`domainator` generates a list of valid domain names that you could register
that, using subdomains or paths, contains the string you provide. It's
automated [domain hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack).

For example, if you wanted to sell a product alled "Chuckles", you might
know that "chuckl.es" is a valid domain.
However, you could _instead_ register
"chu.ck" and redirect your traffic to the `/les` path, giving you "chu.ck/les"
as the homepage.
`domainator` generates a number of these domains for you.
It's a silly project, but a fun way to learn about Nim.

After working on `domainator-nim`, I decided to try rewriting
[@xmonader's Day 7 of Nim days](https://xmonader.github.io/nimdays/day07_shorturl.html),
which I called [shorturl](https://github.com/phildenhoff/shorturl).

shorturl is like any other URL-shortening service, except ‚Äî since it was
intended to be a learning project ‚Äî it has the fatal flow that all of the URLs
are entirely in-memory.
