# Search

[Kagi](https://kagi.com/) is currently my search engine of choice.
Results are just as good as DuckDuckGo (and better than Google (hot take)), except you can also choose to rank certain websites higher or hide them altogether, and the lenses feature is great.
The only downside I have is that something local like "pizza" shows me pretty random results, so I have to include my location for those ones — but that's not a big deal.

# Code editing

Okay, quickly now:

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), in [Neovide](https://github.com/neovide/neovide). For plugins, Ihave:
  - Plenary & Telescope for finding files quickly
  - Sidebar.nvim, instead of NERDTree
  - GitHub Copilot
  - Fugitive
  - EdenEast/nightfox.nvim
  - vim-abolish
  - Various LSP servers, like for Elixir and TypeScript.

Since Neovide just uses my local Neovim (and its config), I get my plugins in both places.
Occasionally, I'll get into a situation where the LSP server can't help me, so I also use VSCode.
And, when massively refactoring, I still crack out IntelliJ.

# Productivity & General

Some of my favourite apps are macOS specific.

- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), which is like Alfred, but using ✨web technologies✨. It's fast.
- [AppGrid](https://github.com/mjolnirapp/AppGrid), a macOS window manager with great hotkeys.
- [Qbserve](https://qotoqot.com/qbserve/) which is a wonderful little tool for tracking your time. The dev, Ivan, is also really receptive and responsive. Worth the money.

And some work across devices.


- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) so I can access my devices from anywhere, securely.

# Command-line tools

Sorry, but I love the recent trend to [#rewriteitinrust](https://github.com/learnbyexample/awesome-rewrite-it-in-rust).
Lots of the tools I use are modern versions of classic Unix programs.

- [Graphite](https://graphite.dev/), which is a super handy tool for stacked PRs.
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat), which is `cat` but better
- [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta), which is a diff tool for Git
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), a fast & user-friendly `find` alternative.
- [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq), for processing JSON
- [lsd](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd), `ls` with images
- [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship), which I use as my ZSH prompt
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) which is a fast-as-hell replacement for `grep`.
- ZSH, since I'm on macOS and am also not a monster.

# Other

- [Parsec](https://parsec.app/), for gaming on my desktop... on my laptop.
