# Search

[Kagi](https://kagi.com/) is currently my search engine of choice.
Results are just as good as DuckDuckGo (and better than Google (hot take)), except you can also choose to rank certain websites higher or hide them altogether, and the lenses feature is great.
The only downside I have is that something local like "pizza" shows me pretty random results, so I have to include my location for those ones — but that's not a big deal.

# Code editing

- VS Code most of the time (with the Catppuccin Latte theme, of course)
- [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) the rest of the time
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) very ocassionally. I added a few too many plugins, I don't like my config, and I haven't had a chance to fix it. Among those many plugins are:
  - Plenary & Telescope, for finding files quickly
  - Sidebar.nvim
  - GitHub Copilot
  - Fugitive
  - EdenEast/nightfox.nvim
  - vim-abolish
  - Various LSP servers, like for Elixir and TypeScript.

Ocassionally, when massively refactoring, I even crack out IntelliJ!
I know, right?
It's crazy!

# Productivity & General

Some of my favourite apps are macOS specific:

- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), which is like Alfred, but using ✨web technologies✨. Don't worry, it's fast.
- [AppGrid](https://github.com/mjolnirapp/AppGrid), a macOS window manager with great hotkeys.
- [Qbserve](https://qotoqot.com/qbserve/) which is a wonderful little tool for tracking your time. The dev, Ivan, is also really receptive and responsive. Worth the money.
- [Xnapper](https://xnapper.com/), a screenshotting tool that I mostly use
  for the padding, borders, and transparency.

And some favourites work across devices:

- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) so I can access my devices from anywhere, securely.

# Command-line tools

Sorry, but I love the recent trend to [#rewriteitinrust](https://github.com/learnbyexample/awesome-rewrite-it-in-rust).
Lots of the tools I use are modern versions of classic Unix programs.

- [Graphite](https://graphite.dev/), a super handy tool for stacked PRs.
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat), `cat` with syntax highlighting
- [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta), a diff tool for Git
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), a fast & user-friendly `find` alternative.
- [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq), for processing JSON
- [exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa), `ls` with icons and more
- [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship), which I use as my prompt
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) an extremely fast `grep` alternative
- Fish shell. I used ZSH for a long time, but I wish I moved to fish sooner.

# Homelab / Self-Hosted

I have an Unraid server on which I host a few things. Mostly I use it for Plex, but I also have:

- Seafile, for "cloud storage" without the cloud
- Umami, for analytics for _this very website!_
- n8n, for some automations like reminding me to review movies I've just watched on Letterboxd.

# Other

- [Parsec](https://parsec.app/), for gaming on my desktop... on my laptop.
